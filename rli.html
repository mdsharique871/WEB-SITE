			<h2><u>Initially, Didn't get Computer Science(CS) in 11th</u></h2>
			<p>When i passed 10th from GNHSS then i wanted to take Science (NON-MED) because only of computer science. So, in GNHSS , computer science was not available . So , i went  to take admission in GNHSS so that i could get CS as a subject .But i gave a entrance exam and got 10th position but there were only 5 seats for CS which had already been taken by other subjects who had got better position than me. So , they said,"You can take admission in Science Med," but i wanted CS and i was doing all the things because only of that. So , i was sad and cried a lot in front of teachers  as i did not get CS .So , sadly i took admission in Med. but was not happy and after 3 days. Computer Science teacher came and said , "Who was that child who was crying a lot as not got CS" and i raised my hand then he said , "Congralutions Sharique !! You got a seat in Non-med as one student left non-med. So, we have decided to give that seat to you as we think you actually need it than anyone else". I cannot tell you that feeling , it was amazing feeling , i was so blissful and I topped in 12th class in all sections </p>

		<h2><u>Lost my 9th marksheet</u></h2>
		<p class=fontsize>As i talked about my CS incident .Now , this is also a  incident which had happened with me at the time of 11th admission .When i cleared the entrance exam as i had said. They asked me to submit 9th marksheet as well as 10th and i had 10th but i had photo copies of 9th marksheet not had the orginal .So , when i went to take admission , they said,"9th marksheet is mandatory" and then i got tense then we went to my home and tried to find the marksheet but unable to and then i went to previous school from where i completed my 9th and 10th , I told them full situation then they called my class teacher then he came and then he found the data of mine so that he could make a new marksheet for me and i remember , i was so hungry that time and was waiting for the new marksheet . So , i always thanks to my class teacher of 9th and 10th class. He came for me on his holiday from 20 km far from school. <br><b>Thank you sir!!! </b></p>
